/**
 * Shared adapter event contract.
 *
 * Both draw adapters (MaplibreDrawAdapter, OLDrawAdapter) expose an on/off bus
 * that emits these events. events.js and the api entry points consume them, so
 * the names and payload shapes below are the contract between the adapters and
 * the framework-agnostic plugin layer.
 *
 * Engine-specific event names stay with their adapter — e.g. the map-level
 * `draw.*` events mapbox-gl-draw fires live in adapters/maplibre/drawEvents.js,
 * and the MapLibre adapter normalises them onto this contract.
 *
 * Payloads:
 *   CREATE                 GeoJSON feature that was drawn
 *   EDIT_FINISH            GeoJSON feature after editing
 *   CANCEL                 (none)
 *   VERTEX_SELECTION       { index, numVertices }
 *   VERTEX_CHANGE          { numVertices }
 *   UNDO_CHANGE            number — current undo stack length
 *   UPDATE                 GeoJSON feature after a vertex operation
 *   GEOMETRY_CHANGE        in-progress geometry (real-time preview, e.g. split)
 *   INTERFACE_TYPE_CHANGE  { interfaceType: 'mouse' | 'touch' | 'keyboard' }
